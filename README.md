# Software Development Process
This personal project was started using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process known as the Extreme Prototyping approach. After the first prototype, a more practical approach such as Agile Development process will be adapted since feedback from a small sample of UTEP students will improve the 2nd prototype. The second prototype will then incorporate the feedback and will be surveyed again when its completed. The 3rd protype will be the final product with the working OSM API as well as the reflected changes from the student feedback. After the 3rd prototype is done then a deployment phase will occur.

# Viewing Prototypes
